Contains set of pc files that enable SGX binaries to be used with autoconf based systems and takes the pain out of cross-compilation. 

- Package-name = sgx-null-gles2 (or sgx-null-gles1)

- Shell script to install this additional pc info to target filesystem. This installs the necessary package information so that pkg-config does find SGX libraries and include paths easily (no more -L and -I)  

- Sample configure.in provided for easy integration


STEPS:

- Execute sgxconfigure.sh with right arguments

- Include the configure.in snippet in your configure.in 

- Perform autoconfig foo as usual
